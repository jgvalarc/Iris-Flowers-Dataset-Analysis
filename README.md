# Machine Learning Exercise

This is a basic ML project which serves as a Project Based Learning exercise. It revolves around:

- Loading a specific Dataset (In this case, data about Iris Flowers)
- Summarizing the Dataset
- Visualizing the Dataset through different plots
- Evaluating different algorithms and selecting the most accurate one
- Making predictions with the selected algorithm

# Files

- **versions.py** and **deep-versions.py**: scripts for cheking environment versions
- **irisData**: for loading Iris Flowers Dataset from public repository
- **irisPlot**: for Dataset visualization
- **irisCompare**: for comparing the precision of different algorithms (in this case, LR, LDA, KNN, CART, NB and SVM). SVM was the most accurate.
- **irisPredictions**: for making prediction using SVM, which displayed the most accuracy in the comparisons.
